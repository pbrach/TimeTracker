##Installation/Dependencies/Starting
0. Operating System: TimeTracker runs on **Windows**, **Mac** and **Linux**.
1. Denpendencies: Have python 3 installed
2. _**On linux**_ make sure that tkinter is installed (on Debian/Ubuntu this 
   is a separate package although it is a native python lib). On Debian/Ubuntu/Mint systems you can install it via *apt-get* and the package *python3-tk*:
   
   ```
   sudo apt-get install python3-tk
   ```
   
3. To start the application navigate via command line to _TimeTracker/source_ and type:
    ```
    python main.py
    ```
    Make sure that the command `python` refers to python 3. On linux in most cases you will need to use the command `python3`, because normally python 2.7 is used as the default version (state 2017-01-04)

4. Alternatively on linux double click the file _TimeTracker/bin/TimeTracker_ (future versions will provide an exe for windows)
